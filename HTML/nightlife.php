Names like Joey Bada$$ and Dragonforce are coming in 2017, and we are sure more big names will show up later on as well.<br>They have a really good bar for serving you cold drinks and beers while you listen to your favourite perfomer, so do not hesitate going there if you can see any artist you would like to watch perform live! </b></p>

It is a chill and calm bar with cheap beers and drinks. If you want alternative people, you have chosen the right place. <br>You get a bit more alternative music than you do at the most popular bars and clubs in Oslo, and who does'nt like that!
